# WebCareerGame

A fully client-side football career simulator rebuilt for fast loading and modern browsers. Create a player, train, accept contract offers and play through procedurally generated seasons without leaving the browser.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` for the landing experience or `game.html` to continue an existing save. All data is stored locally via `localStorage`, so clearing browser storage resets your progress.

## Tech stack

- Vanilla ES modules (no build step)
- Modern CSS with fluid layout tokens
- Persistent save system using `localStorage`

## Development

No tooling is required. Simply open the HTML files in a browser or serve the folder via any static HTTP server.
